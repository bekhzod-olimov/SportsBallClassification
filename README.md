# Sports Ball Classification

This repository contains a deep learning (DL)-based artificial intelligence (AI) image classification model training to classify balls used in different sports types. The AI model used for the classification task is RexNet ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00992.pdf) and [code](https://github.com/clovaai/rexnet)) and the dataset for training is [Sports Balls Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/sports-balls-multiclass-image-classification). The project in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/killa92/sportballs-visualization-classification-pytorch).
